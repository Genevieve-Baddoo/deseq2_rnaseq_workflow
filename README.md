## About

This deseq2 workflow uses RNA-seq data from the following BioProject RNA-seq libraries for the studies of spnE and armi were prepared by using TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Preparation Kit following the protocol offered by Illumina. Total RNA was extracted from the same ovaries as above, and ribosomal RNA is depleted from total RNA. The remaining RNAs were purified, fragmented, reverse transcribed and ligated to Illumina adaptors. dUTPs were then enzymatically removed for strand specificity. PCR amplification and gel purification were performed to make RNA-seq libraries. RNA libraries were subsequently sequenced by Illumina platform.
