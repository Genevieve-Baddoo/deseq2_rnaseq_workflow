## About

This deseq2 workflow uses RNA-seq data from the following BioProject `PRJNA494103`. To summarize, RNA-seq libraries were prepared by using the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Preparation Kit following the Illumina protocol. Total RNA was extracted from adult female Drosophila melanogaster ovaries in triplicate (spnE and mutant), and ribosomal RNA is depleted from the total RNA. Remaining RNAs were purified, fragmented, reverse transcribed and ligated to Illumina adaptors. dUTPs were enzymatically removed for strand specificity. PCR amplification and gel purification were performed to make RNA-seq libraries.
